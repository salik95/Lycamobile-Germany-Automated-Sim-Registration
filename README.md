# Lycamobile-Germany-Automated-Sim-Registration
Lycamobile provides the service to register sims in Germany using their POS. This script automates the whole process as it takes relevant inputs in a function and completes the process by registering and sending the credentials on the registrant's email address to access the POS and perform relevant actions.
